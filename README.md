# Katzen-WL:

## How to build it:
To build you need to use a Meson & Ninja implementation to run the meson.build file personally I use Muon and Samu for testing and can confirm that those work for sure and anything that works in Muon should also work in mainline meson.
```
    meson setup build

    ninja -c build
```
